### Problem 4: **Polymorphism with Method Overloading** (Medium)

**Description:**  
Create a `Calculator` class that has a `multiply()` method which:
1. Accepts two integers and returns their product.
2. Accepts a list of integers and returns the product of all elements in the list.

**Guidance:**  
Use polymorphism to handle different types of inputs to the `multiply` method.

**Goal:**  
This will demonstrate method overloading through parameter variations.
