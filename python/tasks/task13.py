### Problem 8: **Multiple Inheritance** (Advanced)

**Description:**  
Create two classes, `Person` (with name and age) and `Worker` (with `company` and `position`). Create a `Manager` class that inherits from both and adds a `department` attribute.

**Guidance:**  
Practice multiple inheritance by combining features of two classes in a single subclass.

**Goal:**  
Ensure `Manager` inherits both `Person` and `Worker` attributes and methods.
