### Problem 2: **Encapsulation** (Easy)

**Description:**  
Create a `BankAccount` class with private attributes `balance` and `account_number`. Implement methods to:
- Deposit an amount.
- Withdraw an amount (ensure thereâ€™s enough balance).
- Check the balance.

**Guidance:**  
Focus on using private variables (with underscores) and public methods to access or modify them.

**Goal:**  
Encapsulation will protect balance details from unauthorized access.
