### Problem 7: **Encapsulation with Property Decorators** (Intermediate)

**Description:**  
Create a `Student` class with attributes `name` and `_grade`. Use property decorators to:
- Make `_grade` read-only.
- Add a method `update_grade()` to change the grade, but ensure it’s within the range of 0–100.

**Guidance:**  
This helps practice encapsulation by using getters and setters.

**Goal:**  
Prevent invalid grades from being assigned directly.
