### Problem 3: **Inheritance and Method Overriding** (Medium)

**Description:**  
Create a base class `Shape` with a method `area()` that returns `0`. Create subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`, overriding `area()` to return the actual area for each shape.

**Guidance:**  
Demonstrate inheritance with a base class and subclasses, where each subclass has a specialized version of the `area()` method.

**Goal:**  
```python
# Expected Output Example:
# Circle Area: 314.16 (for radius 10)
# Rectangle Area: 50 (for length 10 and width 5)
```
