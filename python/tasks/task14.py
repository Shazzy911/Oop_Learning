### Problem 10: **Polymorphism with Operator Overloading** (Advanced)

**Description:**  
Create a `Vector` class with `x` and `y` coordinates. Overload the `+` and `-` operators to allow addition and subtraction of `Vector` objects.

**Guidance:**  
Demonstrates polymorphism with operator overloading, where operators are adapted for class instances.

**Goal:**  
```python
# Expected Output Example:
# Vector addition: Vector(5, 7) + Vector(2, 3) = Vector(7, 10)
# Vector subtraction: Vector(5, 7) - Vector(2, 3) = Vector(3, 4)
```
