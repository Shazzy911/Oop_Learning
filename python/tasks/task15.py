### Problem 9: **Composition and Encapsulation** (Advanced)

**Description:**  
Create a `Library` class that has a collection of `Book` objects (you can use the `Book` class from Problem 1). Implement methods to:
1. Add a book.
2. Remove a book.
3. Find a book by title.

**Guidance:**  
Use composition to manage `Book` objects within `Library`, encapsulating the list of books.

**Goal:**  
Practice controlling internal data through encapsulation and composition.
