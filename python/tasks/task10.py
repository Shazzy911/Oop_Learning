### Problem 5: **Polymorphism with Method Overriding in Inheritance** (Medium)

**Description:**  
Create a base class `Animal` with a method `sound()` that prints “Some sound.” Create subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`, where each subclass overrides `sound()` to print "Bark" and "Meow" respectively.

**Guidance:**  
This is a classic example of polymorphism, where different classes provide their own implementation of the same method.

**Goal:**  
```python
# Expected Output Example:
# Bark (for Dog object)
# Meow (for Cat object)
```
